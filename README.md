# Dairy CPS

A Python-based application for handling decision logic and model/security structures related to dairy management or process control. This README is tailored to the structure found in this repository.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── decision_logic.py     # Contains decision-making logic for the project (edit this description as needed)
├── main.py               # Main entry point for running the application
├── models/               # Directory for data models (e.g., classes, schemas)
├── security/             # Directory for security-related modules (e.g., authentication, authorization)
```

## Overview

This project appears to be arranged for scalable development, with a clear separation of concerns:
- **decision_logic.py**: Implements logic to make decisions, possibly on dairy operations or management scenarios.
- **main.py**: Empty or a starter file intended as the main entry point. Populate this with application bootstrap code (such as creating the app object, parsing arguments, etc.).
- **models/**: Place your data schemas, ORM models, or domain logic classes here.
- **security/**: Contains logic for security, such as authentication handlers or access control modules.

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment & activate it**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate    # For Windows
   ```
3. **Install requirements**
   (Add a requirements.txt if needed)
